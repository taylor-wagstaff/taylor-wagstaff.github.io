        <h1>Learning Plan:</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Short term, I can see myself being a developer for a company. I am not particularly picky about which company so long as my skills in developing are able to improve and that there is space to continually learn. 
          If my skills grow into a comfortable junior developer, I would like to on the side of work make and produce my own applications and ideas to start to get a sense of the types of things I would like to make. 
          Long term, after having gained proficiency in developing for at least a few years, built solid connections with people and have a feeling for how the technology industry operates I see myself eventually transitioning into blockchain technology. 
          At this point, I would like to see if I can bring in my experience in the art world in making creative things for a blockchain company towards being able to write smart contracts and deploying nfts.
          However, I am still trying to figure this out.  I am so new to this industry. It's difficult to see where I could slot in and make the biggest contribution. So long as I feel I am making a contribution to society, however small or large it is, will provide me the contentment I crave.</p>

        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>When it comes to learning, it is my determination that carries me forward in the learning process. If it is something I am very much interested in achieving, I know that I will have the capacity and ability in myself to complete my goals. Determination allows me to succeed in areas that I desire to succeed in. However, when there are moments in which I fail or misunderstand what's required of me, I have a tendency to really take it to heart and beat myself up. My self-critical inner voice, in moments of failure, can really hold myself back in the learning process. This is mostly due to the pressure to achieve success. I rely on my determination to pull through this feeling, once I am able to rationalize my thoughts and become aware of their inherent critical irrationality. What I mostly struggle with, in regards to specifically the learning process, Is my confusion with what's being asked of me. I either completely misunderstand or misread the direction or overthink to the point of indecisiveness. The way around that is to reread the questions clearly many times and to write down what's required of me. Another limitation, which I am slowly improving on, is that ability to be able to ask for help. Growing up I always considered being independent and able to do things on your own a valued trait. However, it is also an impediment, as sometimes we need others to guide us and help to learn, especially coding where so much of it initially doesn't make sense until we understand its use and how we use it.

        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I would like to learn the art of asking for help when I'm feeling stuck and need guidance. Becoming more confident in general with people socially, especially people I don't know initially. I tend to be a lot more guarded, rather than giving people the benefit of the doubt and trusting their intentions. Improvement in organizational skills and time management, I tend to overwork and neglect other important aspects of my life, especially socially.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>How I will manage myself is to always be polite, show grace and humility to those who are putting themselves forward to accommodate my learning and the learning of others. It is important to not take things for granted. To be given this opportunity is a blessing. I wish to manage myself in a way that is considerate both to the needs of others and my own. I do not wish to interfere in other people's learning journey. It is important for myself to be able to communicate my needs, make myself available and to be honest when there are moments I struggle with, especially working collaboratively with other people. I will always aim to be considerate to how people wish to be perceived and to be aware of my own privileges.
        </p>

        <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>When things start building up and stress me out I will always try to take a moment to breathe and slow down. A self-reminder that there will be many moments like this when coding and that one must lean into the process in order to learn. Otherwise, If I am really stressed out and need to slow down, I will have a brief moment and step away from what I am doing in order to recollect my thoughts. This will allow me to come into the situation with clarity. If things are really stressful and all else has failed, I will make sure to reach out to loved ones by phone for emotional support. My family have always been encouraging and without their support I wouldn't be where I am today. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Currently I have been trying to learn to seek help through the #tech-questions or the homegroup meeting. However, once I am in bootcamp, It's going to be a lot more difficult to reach out, especially if the facilitators are busy. If I cannot find the answer on the internet, or through my own problem solving, I could reach out to other students (so long as it does not interfere in their learning process). Thankfully I have a few close friends doing Dev Academy with me who I know I could rely on for guidance and encouragement.   
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>What I expect from the facilitation team is facilitation. Rather than a teacher/student model, of the teacher telling the students the content, I expect the facilitators to create a learning environment where the student learns how to learn. This means that rather than being told content, I learn how to teach myself and through the sharing/exchange of ideas with other people. I expect them to answer questions if I'm really stuck or to show how to find the answer myself. I expect politeness, courtesy with some encouragement to push the brick walls and to be reminded that it is all part of the learning process. 
          </p>

        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul> 
          <li>On Mondays at 5.00pm I have therapy in town. This is an important commitment for me and has helped me out of a dark place in the past. I am feeling anxious that I might have to leave early to accommodate this time, as I don't want to miss out on necessary learning time, I hope it doesn’t interfere too much.</li>
          <li>Exercise is very important for me and I try to exercise daily through running. If I am doing very long days, I will have to create a time slot that fits into my schedule. Perhaps waking up very early and going for a run could work. My normal time slot is around 5pm, as that is when I feel I am most energized for exercise and it fits neatly before cooking dinner. However, If I am working very late, exercise in the morning might be the best way forward.</li> 
          <li>It is also important to have at least one social event with friends each week. Something simple like going out for dinner or hanging out at their houses. Although I have my flatmates as well for that social time, It's important for me to maintain connections with friends and to not feel isolated or that I have neglected my friends during the bootcamp. This time I leave for Saturday night or Sunday.</li>
        </ul>
