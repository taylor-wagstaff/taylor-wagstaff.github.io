          <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
  
          <p>The principles have the possibility to re-orientate how an individual might change the process of how we learn. It has the capacity to reshape and rewire important neural pathways of the brain through cognitive activity, even the power of imagination without its physical dimension, such as learning to play an instrument through imagination only still can produce learning outcomes as it would its physical. Neuroplasticity benefits people because it allows an individual to overcome their own self-limiting beliefs such as “i'm not good at math” because such a belief actually creates neural pathways and reshapes the brain towards this goal.</p>
  
          <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
            </h3>
  
          <p>
            How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity is to take the idea of overcoming self-limiting beliefs and applying that to my mode of learning. In instances where I think that coding is for super intelligent math nerds, I know now that any thoughts like this are designed to impede learning. The principle of repetition I very much engage in and believe in its developmental potential. I have learned many skills using this method, such as playing guitar or painting, which has involved many hours over years to reach the point at which I am now. I will apply the same logic to coding as would any other thing I wish to learn and be good at. 
            </p>
  
          <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
          </h3>
  
          <p>Repetition and overcoming self-limiting beliefs, as stated above, are two ways I could increase my neuroplasticity. I like the idea of imagination being integrated into the learning process. I have been attempting to remember javaScript code through imaginative associations with those functions. In a way this is attempting to remember code by creating new neural connections in the brain to help both with memory and their use cases. For instance, a variable to me is like a mini usb, able to store information and be plugged in at will. </p>

          <h3>Discuss what Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant.</h3>
  
          <p>Growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed mindset. How they are different is that in a growth mindset the individual believes that they are capable of learning even if problems may at first appear too complex or unmanageable. The attitude of a growth mindset would believe that such challenges are naturally part of the learning process whereas a fixed mindset would believe that it is above them or that they do not have the ability to complete difficult problems. </p>
  
          <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
  
          <p>No there were no surprises, I have been aware of the discourse around growth mentality for some time, although mostly expressed in different ways in self-help books. </p>
  
          <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
  
          <p>The main integration of the growth mindset is the overcoming of self-limiting beliefs. And when I hit a wall to a problem which seems beyond me, is to recognise that it's all part of the learning process. The idea is to not freak out and embrace the challenge that presents to me in the now. Even if the answer is wrong, as long as I have given it its best shot is all that matters. </p>

          <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
            </h3>
  
          <p>In my learning plan, part of the difficulties I face with learning is the comprehension of what is being asked of me in the assignment and my self-critical voice. Integrating both Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset will allow me to re-conceptualize their beliefs. Perhaps the difficulty of comprehension doesn't actually exist and is completely made up. I remember it being a recurring element of my early school years where teachers would assign the belief that I had the ability however I tended to get the answer wrong because I misunderstood what was being asked of me. With my self-critical voice, however, it's about becoming aware of how this voice is actually reshaping my brain and that I have the ability to construct it in a different way.

        <h1>Emotional intelligence</h1>

      
        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

        <p>Emotional Intelligence is an individual's awareness of their own emotional feelings. This awareness is characterized by the ability for the individual to pay attention to, and respond to, their own feelings in a way that is productive rather than unproductive or dehumanizing. Emotional Intelligence is predominantly shaped by our upbringing, especially in how we both received and gave love in our relationships with our parents. Our childhood and into our adult lives can produce emotional habits and responses which may be detrimental to our emotional well being. Emotional intelligence is the human expression of how we can manage these habits, or even repair and change them into a way of being that is one of lightness. 
        </p>

        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>

        <p>IQ, which is short for intelligence quotient, is described as the capacity for an individual to problem solve, use logic in interesting ways, grasp intelligent ideas and communicate them to others. In a sense, IQ is the expression of an individual's intelligence exerted through the world and emotional intelligence is the individual's awareness of their own emotions and their ability to regulate them.

          <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration:</h1>
          <h3>The Sun is in <span class="scorpio">Scorpio</span>:</h3>
      
          <figure><img src="../blog/Images/natal-chart.png" alt="Natal chart" class="compass"><figcaption>Natal Chart</figcaption></figure>
      
            <p>Scorpios are known for their intensity. They are determined folk that absolutely throw themselves into whatever they do -- but getting them to commit to something is rarely an easy task. In fact, it's better not to even try to "get them" to do anything. Solar Scorpios absolutely have their own mind. And, their primary motivation is unlikely to be prestige (like their Capricorn friends), or even authority (Leos can have that, too)--it's real power. Their power can absolutely be of the "behind the scenes" variety, just as long as they have it.
             To others, Scorpios seem to have plenty of willpower. They probably do. Scorpios do know what they want, and they won't go out and grab it at the wrong moment. They simply sit back, watch (quite expertly), and then get it only when the moment is just right. This apparent patience is simply their powerful skills at strategy at work. Scorpio isn't afraid of getting their hands (their bodies, their minds) dirty. The darker side of life intrigues them, and they're always ready to investigate.
             Scorpios simply never give up. They have tremendous staying power. They're not in the slightest intimidated by anybody or anything. Confrontations are not a problem. In fact, talk to any Scorpio about their lives, and you'll probably be in awe at all they've gone through. Trauma seems to follow them wherever they go. When Scorpio learns optimism, instead of expecting the worst, they'll find that they possess amazing regenerative powers -- the power to heal, create, and transform.

            <h2>Sun in X: The Sun is in the tenth house:</h2>
              <p>The urge to work toward a goal, for success and accomplishment, and/or for power is part of your make-up. You are uncomfortable in any position in which you must "take orders" from someone else. Recognize your ambitions and your need for authority without going overboard. Seek out a career that allows you to manage, rather than be managed, if possible. It is crucial that you accept the part of you that is ambitious, but take pains not to over-identify with an image that is not really you! Successful career is guaranteed, but may sometimes come late.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Square between the Sun and Moon:</h2>
              <p>You have an internal struggle between your needs and your wants. You can lack focus and be indecisive as a result. Your ability to be objective is both an asset and a liability, simply because when you decide on one route, you are pulled in another direction at the same time. Something tugs at you, and you begin to question your stance. "But what if..." and "on the other hand..." are statements you can't help but make, and that might plague you. You are always aware of the opposing point of view and the other side of the coin.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Conjunction between the Sun and Mars:</h2>
              <p>You are enterprising and have powerful stores of energy that you can draw upon when needed. You respond to problems or challenges with a spirited and enthusiastic confidence that is admirable. You are naturally competitive, and this trait is generally well-received by others simply because it is unforced, unaffected, and sincere. You truly believe in fair play, and you seem to be in love with life. When you are expressing competitiveness and courage, it's easy for others to smile and accept these traits as positive ones rather than being rubbed the wrong way. You have good physical vitality. Although competitive, you are not naturally combative. You may enjoy sports or games that are competitive, but not violent. Breaking the rules of a competitive game is particularly upsetting to you. You are more able than most to control your desires, aggressions, and instincts. You know how to be fair, and you expect others to be fair. As such, sneaky behaviors, uncontrolled impulses, violence, and rage are offensive to you.
              </p>
        
          <h2>Sextile between the Sun and Jupiter:</h2>
              <p>Endowed with generosity and friendliness, in some ways you appear to be lucky in life. You attract good things with a positive frame of mind and a charitable disposition. Rarely entirely "down and out", you are usually well-received, helpful, and well-informed. You may enjoy travel and have a special affection for foreign places and people. You're generally not very competitive, and for the most part not combative either. As a result, you are usually well-liked. You are usually good-hearted, possessing strong morals and much faith in life and in people. You prefer to find the good in situations and in people. You don't have a lot of patience with those who break the rules, as you generally believe in order, equality, and the law. You usually make good on your promises, and the sincerity you exude can be trusted. Looking on the bright side is your forte--people can turn to you for a pleasing dose of faith and optimism. You are quick to chuckle and can't resist any appeal to your sense of humor. Some people with this aspect are downright jolly. Others are less conspicuous, but their faith in life and willingness to find humor in life are nevertheless obvious.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Square between the Sun and Saturn:</h2>
              <p>You faced a fair number of challenges in your life, especially in the first half of life, in which your attempts to express your will were often thwarted. There can be a persistent feeling that you don't get what they want in comparison to others. You can feel unlucky at times. Attempts to control your environment, and sometimes others, may be frequent. You want to be considered an accomplished and important person, and when you face obstacles, you don't always see that you are your own worst enemy. You may long to be considered important in the eyes of the world, yet you harbor fear of success at the same time. You take failures and minor setbacks to heart, and may even practically beat yourself up over them. Self-awareness to the point of real self-consciousness is a possibility. The truth is, nobody holds a microscope over you, except for yourself. A little setback or a faux pas needn't be analyzed to death. Fingers needn't be pointed. No, you didn't make a spectacle of yourself when you made a mistake. You need to stop worrying about always being right, or appearing suave and accomplished. When you ease the pressure you put on yourself, you find that you don't face as many brick walls. It is very much about what you feel you deserve. Deep down inside, if you let yourself truly believe that you deserve happiness and peace of mind, you will find it.You may engage in a lot of self-censoring: "I shouldn't.." is a common censoring mechanism with you. When you express egotism of any form, some part of you feels guilty. As the Sun rules our conscious mind, it does enough censoring on its own. It is the "adult" within us. Saturn, on the other hand, is more like the "parent" within us. We need parents to guide us when we are children, and to some degree as adults, but for the most part, we don't need to be censored indefinitely--something that seems to be the case with Saturn-Sun hard aspects, except that the censoring and parenting is coming from within. Ideally, you eventually learn that the standards you set for yourself are too high, and that may be the reason you seem to hit brick walls. You have a sarcastic sense of humor, a keen intelligence, and the ability to apply caution and strategy. The vitality may suffer, and troubles with the bones, teeth, and circulation may surface, especially at times of stress in your life.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Sextile between the Sun and Uranus:</h2>
              <p>It is natural for you to question tradition. You are, above all things, an individualist. You naturally rebel against that which is established. It doesn't mean that you consistently break all the rules, but you definitely do question some of the rules, especially those that simply don't make much sense. You possess a huge distaste for routine. You work best when you have some say as to when and how you get things done. You possess much self-integrity. You avoid labeling people and are most offended when others attempt to label or stereotype you. You easily embrace new ways of doing things, you stick up for the underdog, and you express yourself in unique and inspiring ways. You don't have to try to stand out as unique--you are original, creative, and progressive without trying. You are far from pretentious. You value honesty and truth, and you avoid putting on airs. You believe in the equality of people, and easily relate to people from all walks of life. You possess an unmistakable enthusiasm about life, and generally your life is interesting because you invite unusual or adventurous experiences into your life. You are generally appreciated by others because you are open-minded, fair, and not judgmental. Nothing really seems to faze you! You take things in stride, and are rarely shocked or taken aback by human behavior. You have an emotional need to be useful, to work productively, to be organized and on top of things, and to lead a healthy life. If these matters are chaotic in your life, it's a symptom of emotional unrest. You need a lot of variety on the job--to be stimulated and engaged in order to feel happy. Some of you might seem to change jobs often, forever in search of the "perfect fit" job. Acceptance that any job requires some level of routine is hard for you.
              </p>
              
          <h2>Mercury in X: Mercury is in the tenth house:</h2>
              <p>You are good with language, and generally use this talent in your profession. You can have an authoritative air about you, or you are talented at communicating and negotiating with those in authority. You might have more than one job going at once much of the time, you could change your career directions frequently, or you could be attracted to jobs that keep you on the move. You require frequent changes of setting or activities in order to remain stimulated and challenged. You are skilled at bringing fresh energy to your conversations or to your job, perhaps because you need the stimulation.</p>
              </p>
      
          <h2>Mars in X: Mars is in the tenth house:</h2>
              <p>He devotes lots of energy to work, and this can continue well into old age. He is a dedicated worker, not afraid of getting down to it. He improves upon his living conditions, rising above his station at birth. He can complete long-term tasks successfully and with finesse. He is easily excitable, often quick to become upset and in the same vein criticizes even himself.

          <figure><img src="../blog/Images/tarot-spread.JPG" alt="Tarot Spread"  class="spread"><figcaption>Tarot Spread (Completed 21st of May)</figcaption></figure>
      
      
          <h2>Card 1: Position represents the situation.</h2> 
      
            <h3>Nine of pentacles.</h3>
              <p>In a general context, the Nine of Pentacles is a great omen to get as it represents success, independence, confidence, freedom, security and stability. It is a Minor Arcana card of abundance, prosperity and wealth gained through hard work, self-discipline and control and self-reliance. It signifies that you have worked very hard to create the success and status you are experiencing and now is the time to enjoy it.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 2: position which crosses card 1, represents the current challenge affecting the issue.
            </h2> 
      
            <h3>King of Wands.</h3>
              <p>In a general context, the King of Wands indicates that you will have the energy, experience and enthusiasm to accomplish what you set out to achieve at this time. You are taking control of your life. You will motivate those around you, lead the way forward and set a good example for those who look up to you. You do not worry about other people’s opinion of you and you dare to be different when this Minor Arcana card appears in your Tarot reading.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 3: position represents the basis of the situation.</h2>
      
            <h3>Two of Swords.</h3>
              <p>In a general context, the Two of Swords represents a stalemate, truce or being at a crossroads. It indicates that you are sitting on the fence or struggling to make/ avoiding a difficult, stressful or painful decision. It is the Minor Arcana of coming face to face with your fears.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 4: Represents the past relevant to the situation.</h2>
      
            <h3>Death (Reversed).</h3>
              <p>In a general context, Death reversed indicates that you are resisting a change that is necessary for you to move forward. Nothing new can begin while you are holding on to this old negative energy. Death indicates that while you are finding it difficult to let go, once you do, new energy will come into your life to give you a new brighter beginning. The change the Death Tarot card reversed brings is not something you can resist forever, if you keep holding onto the things you should be letting go of, the universe will find a way to push you on to your life path in its own way.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 5: The present.</h2>
      
            <h3>The Empress (Reversed)</h3>
              <p>You may be focusing too much on the material and mental aspects of life, rather than the emotional and spiritual when this Major Arcana card appears. The disharmony indicated by The Empress reversed can take many forms. You may be putting others needs before your own to your detriment. Or you may feel so emotionally overwhelmed that you are neglecting those that are important to you. You may also feel unattractive and undesirable and your confidence has taken a knock. You will need to shift the focus and ground yourself to correct this imbalance.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 6: Represents the near future.</h2>
        
            <h3>Seven of swords.</h3>
              <p>In a general context, the Seven of Swords represents deception, lies, trickery, cheating and lack of conscience.  This card also signifies mental manipulation, tactics, scheming, cunning, enemies who masquerade as friends and spies in your camp. It is a Minor Arcana card of dangerous or risky behaviour, daring, courage and staying ahead of the game. The Seven of Swords can also represent flexibility, adaptability, sharp wit, resourcefulness, being strategic or being overly rational.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 7: Represents your power in the situation.</h2>
      
            <h3>Eight of cups.</h3>
              <p>In a general context, the Eight of Cups reversed can indicate stagnation. When it appears you may be accepting your lot in life or staying in bad situation that makes you terribly unhappy because you are afraid of moving on or worried about what the future might hold if you leave. You may appear happy to those around you but underneath it all you know you need to get let go of certain people or situations in your life in order to move forward. You are resisting this change because you are paralysed by fear.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 8: Represents the effects of people around you.</h2>
          
            <h3>King of swords (Reversed)</h3>
              <p>In a general context, the King of Swords reversed can represent lack of structure, routine, self-discipline, power or authority. When reversed it is a Minor Arcana card of not using your head or losing your cool. Alternatively, it can represent being power hungry, inhumane or a tyrant. This card reversed signifies a lack of logic, reason, integrity, ethics or morals.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 9: Represents your hopes or fears.</h2>
      
            <h3>Queen of pentacles.</h3>
              <p>In a general Tarot spread, the Queen of Pentacles represents high social status, prosperity, wealth, luxury, success and financial independence. This Minor Arcana card tells you to approach issues in a sensible, practical, no-nonsense manner and you will be successful. She tells you to set goals and work towards them steadily.
              </p>
      
          <h2>Card 10: Represents the final outcome.</h2>
      
            <h3>Page of wands.</h3>
              <p>In a general context, the Page of Wands represents good news that should be coming to you swiftly or shortly. This may take the form of letters, phone calls or word of mouth. This Minor Arcana card also signifies having bright ideas about what you can do, being inspired or creative, making new exciting plans, thinking big and finding something you are passionate about. It can also indicate that you may have a tendency to rush into new things without thinking them through fully when it appears in your Tarot spread.

        <h2>What is Enneagram?</h2>
          <p>According to the Enneagram, each of the nine personality types is defined by a particular core belief about how the world works. This core belief drives your deepest motivations and fears — and fundamentally shapes a person's worldview and the perspective through which they see the world and the people around them. Our core beliefs are not necessarily incorrect, but they can be limiting and operate as “blinders” for people. Understanding our Enneagram type and how it colors our perceptions can help us to broaden our perspective and approach situations more effectively. Understanding a person's Enneagram type helps us to see why they behave the way they do. Each Enneagram type has a set of core beliefs that will consistently motivate them to take particular actions and guide them to make certain decisions. Behavior that may seem confusing or contradictory can often be explained when we understand a person's Enneagram type.
            The Enneagram also helps us understand how people react to stress. By describing how each Enneatype adapts and responds to both stressful and supportive situations, the Enneagram shows opportunities for personal development and provides a foundation for the understanding of others.

        <h2>Type Three in Brief:</h2>
          <p>Threes are self-assured, attractive, and charming. Ambitious, competent, and energetic, they can also be status-conscious and highly driven for advancement. They are diplomatic and poised, but can also be overly concerned with their image and what others think of them. They typically have problems with workaholism and competitiveness. At their Best: self-accepting, authentic, everything they seem to be—role models who inspire others.
          </p>
      
          <ul> 
            <li>Basic Fear: Of being worthless</li>
            <li>Basic Desire: To feel valuable and worthwhile</li> 
            <li>Enneagram Three with a Two-Wing: "The Charmer"</li>
            <li>Enneagram Three with a Four-Wing: "The Professional"</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h2>Key Motivations:</h2>
          <p>Want to be affirmed, to distinguish themselves from others, to have attention, to be admired, and to impress others.</p>
          <p>Everyone needs attention, encouragement, and the affirmation of their value in order to thrive, and Threes are the type which most exemplifies this universal human need. Threes want success not so much for the things that success will buy (like Sevens), or for the power and feeling of independence that it will bring (like Eights). They want success because they are afraid of disappearing into a chasm of emptiness and worthlessness: without the increased attention and feeling of accomplishment which success usually brings, Threes fear that they are nobody and have no value.
          </p>
          <p>The problem is that, in the headlong rush to achieve whatever they believe will make them more valuable, Threes can become so alienated from themselves that they no longer know what they truly want, or what their real feelings or interests are. In this state, they are easy prey to self–deception, deceit, and falseness of all kinds. Thus, the deeper problem is that their search for a way to be of value increasingly takes them further away from their own Essential Self with its core of real value. From their earliest years, as Threes become dependent on receiving attention from others and in pursuing the values that others reward, they gradually lose touch with themselves. Step by step, their own inner core, their “heart’s desire,” is left behind until they no longer recognize it.
          </p>
          <p>Thus, while they are the primary type in the Feeling Center, Threes, interestingly, are not known as “feeling” people; rather, they are people of action and achievement. It is as if they “put their feelings in a box” so that they can get ahead with what they want to achieve. Threes have come to believe that emotions get in the way of their performance, so they substitute thinking and practical action for feelings.
          </p>
          <p>Threes report that when they realize to what extent they have adapted their lives to the expectations of others, the question arises, “Well, then, what do I want?” They often simply did not know; it was not a question that had ever come up before. Thus, the fundamental dilemma of Threes is that they have not been allowed to be who they really are and to manifest their own authentic qualities. At a young age, they got the message that they were not allowed to have feelings and be themselves: they must, in effect, be someone else to be accepted. To some degree, all of the personality types have been sent the same message, but because of their particular background and makeup, Threes not only heard it, they began to live by it. The attention they received by performing in a certain way was their oxygen, and they needed it to breathe. Unfortunately, it came at a high price.

        <div class="Evidence">
      
      <h1>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values:</h1>
      
          <p><strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
          </strong></p>
          <p>I had to make many ethical decisions when I was teaching during my Doctorate degree. While teaching, many students would request extensions on assessments and often had to consider my own values with that of the institution. This dynamic I often found difficult to negotiate. As a Scorpio, with reference to my natal chart, it states that I “have an emotional need to be useful,” which is often expressed as the desire to be useful for others or to take on other problems as my own. This became often conflicted with the accommodation of students' needs in relation to submitting assessments, such as students requesting extensions for very minor reasons. The consequences of my actions often led me in conflict with professors at the university who believed I was far too lenient. Even though perhaps I didn't agree with the educational learning structure, this is a situation where my values conflicted with the values of the institution.  
            While I was working at the Auckland Art Gallery as a team leader for the gallery assistants, I would often have to make tough decisions regarding the performance of others' work. If fellow team members were slack, I often felt conflicted in asserting authority. As referenced above in my Enneagram Type, I am “highly concerned with [...] performance, doing [the] job well, [and] constantly driving self to achieve goals as if self-worth depends on it.” When I believed I failed to express authority, which was required for the job, I would tend to feel moments of failure and weakness as the level of performance was not met. The consequences of this were minor disruptions in the day-to-day running of the gallery and in order to ensure appropriate performance I would often adopt the responsibilities of others for my own.  
          </p>
      
          <p><strong>How your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong> 
          </p>
          <p>I tend to think of culture as the summation of values and taste/interests concerning those within my social group. As a practicing artist, within the very small and insular art scene, my peers also tended to be creative and daring. There is a silent code of fashion style, which they would never outright admit, is a part of the admission process. In terms of values and identity, there are aspects I do admire within my culture, such as creativity, sociability, attention to aesthetics, intelligent ideas and conversation, the focus on what is novel or “cool” and a sense of togetherness around a shared interest. These values certainly helped shape my identity. Although there have been moments of a desire to escape this social group, especially attempting to keep up with appearances or feeling as though you have not contributed creatively more generally.  This is especially apparent in my Enneagram type, where it states I can “be overly concerned with their image and what others think of them,” and I think this tendency has a way of creating emotional distress for me in my cultural environment. However, there are many good things that I believe I have gained through my culture. One major influence would be the artistic nature of disrupting or challenging pre-existing rules. In art making, this is an important attribute as you want to create something new and challenge what came before. This idea is expressed in my Natal chart, it states that “above all things, [I am] an individualist. [ I ] naturally rebel against that which is established. It doesn't mean that [ I ] consistently break all the rules, but [ I ] definitely do question some of the rules, especially those that simply don't make much sense.”  
          </p>
      
      <h1>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations:</h1>
          
          <p><strong>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</strong></p>
          <p>As noted in my Enneagram type, it states that I am “ambitious and highly driven for advancement.” I believe this to be true. In my career development, my ambition and drive has served me well to the point of reaching desired goals and accomplishments that I am proud of. It is this ambition which has helped me to apply for Dev Academy as I believe I have the ability to complete such a difficult and intense form of learning programme. However, such ambition can lead to extremely high expectations of accomplishment. When I believe I have failed to meet these expectations, it can cause emotional distress. As also mentioned in my natal chart, where I “want to be considered an accomplished and important person, and when I face obstacles, I don't always see that you are your own worst enemy,” articulates that when its comes to my career development it is myself and not others that tend to produce unintended consequences. Such consequences could mean self-critical evaluation or when I have failed to meet a set standard - bitter disappointment.   
          </p>
      
          <p><strong>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</strong></p>
          <p>Creativity, which is much prized in my former field of Fine Arts, I believe to be an effective strength. This will help me in my learning journey for this course as sometimes problem solving requires a creative approach to “think outside the box.” However, sometimes this can be an impediment as I would go too far outside the problem, of what might be deemed a simple fix to a simple problem. As mentioned in my natal chart, that I am “above all things, an individualist,” can be considered both a strength and a learning obstacle. It's a strength that produces an independence of self-responsibility in relation to how I learn, however, it also means that I struggle with asking for help from others and this is something I would like to learn how to do.  
          </p>
      
          <p><strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong></p>
          <p>I was teaching a performance art paper for a semester and oftentimes there was resistance from other students. Performance art requires an opening up both emotionally and physically. This is a very vulnerable thing to do, especially as a student straight from high school who isn't used to such unusual learning environments. I would use many learning strategies such as getting students to share personal things about themselves, activities designed to create a comfortable environment and get the students to reenact performance art pieces. One particular activity, which is common in performance papers, is for everyone in the class to come together and hold each other forming one singular mass. Eventually the group will move throughout the space as if on their own. This is a very effective technique for bonding the students and opening them up for learning. In hindsight, other strategies I would try now would be more time spent sharing emotionally. Students were very worried as to how they wish to be perceived, and to be fair I was also concerned with being an effective teacher. Spending more time on the emotional sharing could have been effective in creating genuine bonds between students.
