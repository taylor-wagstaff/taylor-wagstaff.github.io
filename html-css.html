      <h1>Technical Blog - Problem Solving</h1>

      <br><br><br><br><br><br>

      <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>

      <p>1. Were blocked on a simple problem:</p>

      <p>What was the problem?</p>

      <p>The problem was how to capitalize each letter of each word on a given sentence. This sentence is passed through a function. I had to write a sequence of steps in the function in order to achieve this.</p>

      <p>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</p>

      <p>I predominantly used the Pseudocode technique of writing out in comments each step of code that needed to be rendered. I then would test out each step and just try heaps of random things like adjusting the inputs of different methods to see what would change. I found console logging each step to be extremely helpful in this problem because I could actively see my changes in the test panel. However, it was googling to find the right methods and how they could be stitched together which really helped me. Finally I asked for help and what I was missing was a single space in a method. </p>

      <p>How did you feel throughout the process?</p>

      <p>I felt extremely dumb because it was taking me so long to complete the problem of over eight hours spent trying. I was continually frustrated. Felt like giving up on numerous occasions. Had feelings of “why am I even doing this.”</p>

      <p>What did you learn?</p>

      <p>Firstly I learnt how the problem could be solved and extended my knowledge of javaScript. I learnt that perseverance eventually pays off. Perhaps I should have reach out much sooner than I should have. </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>2. Elegantly solved a problem.</p>

      <p>What was the problem?</p>

      <p>The problem was trying to locate a word called buzz and filter out all of the words within the string. </p>

      <p>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</p>

      <p>Again I used the Pseudocode technique of writing everything out and using google to understand the filter method.</p>

      <p>How did you feel throughout the process?</p>

      <p>I felt much better because I could apply everything I had learned in the previous method problem. It took me only 10mins and once I finished it I actually had a brief feeling of self pride. </p>

      <p>What did you learn?</p>

      <p>I learnt that once you take the time to understand something it is much easier to apply it second time around. </p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>

      <p>Pseudocode: This would be my main form of problem solving methods. This is because it converts complicated coding language into plain easy to understand english. It also has the added benefit for other coders to look over your code and pick things up where they left off. I am confident in this technique because it is my main problem solving technique and has the most impact for me. </p>

      <p>Trying something: This can be helpful, however, I find that too much of just trying something can end in many hours wasted. It can help when you think you're very close to the correct answer because you're just testing random inputs to adjust the output. </p>

      <p>Rubber ducky method: Actually this has helped, although not to a rubber duck just to my friend in discord. Once I communicate out loud it is much easier to spot where you went wrong or to clarify the problem more in depth.</p>

      <p>Reading error messages: Honestly I still don't really understand the error messages completely, it's mostly handy when it locates the exact line of code of where the fault is. </p>

      <p>Console.logging: This has been a life saver because it allows you to visualize the actual things that passed through the code. I am pretty confident using it now, I couldn't really get it to work well in DevTools, however, in Replit it was easy to use. </p>

      <p>Googling: I am getting better than using google for code. Most of the time it's knowing what to ask for in the first place and oftentimes the examples dont neatly fit into the code I'm working in. I find many of the docs for javascript just extremely vague and the examples they use always look very strange. I wished they applied the examples to actual real examples rather than just console logging it. I prefer random medium articles about a subject to be the most beneficial. </p>

      <p>Asking your peers for help: I am confident in asking peers for help plus it's nicer because they are experiencing the same amount of stress and confusion as I am. It is good when we share screens and compare different styles of coding or methods to complete the problem.</p>

      <p>Asking coaches for help: I am not confident asking for help which I already know. Eventually I caved on the methods section because it was taking hours and hours of my life. The coach cleared up my issue pretty quickly and was able to go through what I was doing wrong. It is the best method if everything else fails. </p>

      <p>Improving your process with reflection: I don't really enjoy the reflections too much because there are so many. It's ok when it's occasional, I have no idea if it helps to be honest. </p>

      <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>

      <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS:</h2>

      <p>Because I am also a painter, I will use a painting analogy to describe their interactions. Since HTML, or HyperText Markup language, gives structure and meaning to a webpage through basic building blocks of code resembles the very materials, such as oil paint, canvas, brushes etc on which to build a painting from. CSS, or cascading style sheets, is the way in which the colors are mixed ending in the resulting style in which the painting is carried out. I tend to see JavaScript as the animation or the action of painting itself. Each painting technique resembles the many javaScript techniques that the artist could choose from to bring life to their painting, in much the same way that coders bring life to their website through Javascript.</p>

      <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>

      <p>Control flow is the order in which your computer reads and processes code, from top to bottom in the document. It starts from the very first line and ends in the last line. When writing code, we have to be aware of control flow and consider not only the order in which things are read, however in moments we might have to tell the computer to read different parts at different times. </p>
      <p>Loops are iteration statements or a piece of code which tells the computer to perform a loop over and over again. There are many different times of loops, however, the most common is the ‘For Loop’ and it keeps continuing until there is nothing left to run through or it is based on a defined condition.</p>
      <p>Now taking these two rough definitions of Control Flow and Loops, if we apply them to an everyday activity like running we can begin to understand them more conceptually. 
        The Control Flow is the order or sequence of movements the body makes to perform one unit of running, such as the brain telling the foot to raise forward and plant itself ahead and the other leg next producing a sequence. Other movements such as breath, opening up of the chest, movement of the arms etc which are all part of the sequence and which are read quickly and in succession. Now the For Loop is this unit of running played out over and over again, that is until the body can no longer handle the sequence. When this happens the condition of being tired stops the loop, otherwise the person could run for infinity.
        </p>

       <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
        </h2> 
        <p>The DOM stands for Document Object Model, as it is defined by the logical structure in which it is accessed by the computer. All of your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files are either stored in a local or global server and the order in which these files are linked and structured determine how it is meant to be read by the computer. With the DOM, coders can build and create documents, adding and removing elements, write code or delete elements etc. In javaScript, I might use the DOM to access elements with different document types. For example, I could use the code document.GetElementById to locate an element of my choosing and then use .innerHTML to access it within the document. 
          </p>

        <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
          </h2>
    
        <p>An object is used when we create a named object, like a character, book title, product item or whatever name we wish to use to represent a digital object or container of information. An object is generally given a value and a key assigned to it. Such as:</p>
          
        <p text align="left">Example 'person' object</p>

        <p text align="left">var person = {</p> 
        <p text align="left">name: 'Taylor',</p> 
        <p text align="left">age: 14,</p> 
        <p text align="left">};</p>
       
        <p>An array however we use to create a collection of multiple things in a given variable. Arrays are especially helpful when we use collections of a similar type and group them together to make it easier to deal with in code. Within an array, we can access them by number in the order that they are written out in code. Arrays can contain many things like objects can as well, such as strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays. </p>
        
        <p text align="left">Here is a basic array:</p>

        <p text align="left">var painterNames = ['claudeMonet', 'jacksonPollock, ‘andyWarhol', 'joanMitchell'];</p> 
    
     <p>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects is that when we want to access data from an object we refer to it by its variables we have placed inside of it. With an array however, we access through its numerical placement in the array. 
    </p>

      <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>

      <p>Functions are one of the many building blocks of javascript. Functions are similar to a set of instructions which are executed by the computer. Within the scope of the function, which is between the curly branches, we define what we would like the computer to perform for us. We can declare a new variable, including operators, loops, booleans or many other things we would like it to perform. We usually give the function a name that relates to its purpose in the overall script. 
      </p>

      <p text align="left">Here is a simple function:</p>

      <p text align="left">function square(number) {</p>
      <p text align="left"> return number * number;</p>
      <p text align="left">}</p>

      <p>In this function we can see it has a name of square, number is inscribed to its parameter, and within its scope we ask it to perform a return on the calculation of the number multiplied by itself. Meaning is number = 2, if we call the function that result would equal 4. Functions are useful in that we can make functions a standalone entity and define them in any way we want. This is what makes javaScript unique as it allows us to be able to refer to functions by name later on in our code, making it more compact and easier to deal with.

      <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
  
     
  
        
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>margin</p>
      <p>/ˈmɑːdʒɪn/</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>noun</p>
      <p>1.</p>
      <p>The edge or border of something.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>border</p>
      <p>/ˈbɔːdə/</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>noun</p>
      <p>1.</p>
      <p>The edge or boundary of something, or the part near it.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>padding</p>
      <p>/ˈpadɪŋ/</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>noun</p>
      <p>1.</p>
      <p>Soft material such as foam or cloth used to pad or stuff something.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Following each of these definitions above we can begin to understand what these terms mean individually within a CSS context. 
        If we follow the CSS box model, which simply means a box or container holding content, such as text, we can visualize how each 
        of these terms signify how they are meant to be understood. Each box can contain margins, borders and padding. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Here’s an example of a castle to help us visualize these properties:</p>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/castle.png" alt="Castle" class="castle"><figcaption>Castle as example</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Here’s an example of a box model to help us visualize these properties for CSS:</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/example-1.png" alt="Example one" class="example-one-img"><figcaption>Box Model as example</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Above, we can see how each of these terms relate to their inferred meaning. 
        The margin, by the definition above, functions as the edge occupying around the content of the box.
        Think of the margin as the grass that surrounds the castle. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Second is the border, which is nested between the margin and padding. 
        The border is the boundary or the castle’s outer walls so to speak.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Finally the padding, if we return to the above definition as a “soft material such as foam or cloth used to pad or stuff something” is a helpful way to visualize how the padding operates. 
        The padding, which is normally the same as the background color as defined for the box container, packs the content or wraps the content in an area of empty space.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>When applied in CSS, the margin, padding and border can all be increased or decreased in size through declaring how much or how little in number declarations. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/example-2.png" alt="Example two" class="example-two-img"><figcaption>Box Model number specifying</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>We can then see each specific properties for the margin, padding and border. 
        In the above example in the browser, the border is set as ‘solid thin black’, the margin has a size of ‘2em’ and the padding is ‘2em’ as well. 
        An ‘em’ is a unit of measurement, although ‘px’ for pixels can also be used. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The following CSS code below represents the example above.
         This section of code is stored in your CSS file and determines how the HTML should look:
      </p>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/example-3.png" alt="Example three" class="example-three-img"><figcaption>CSS code example</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <p>Specifying padding and margins in em is good practice as it allows easier transformation in different mobile formats. 
        Em works by conforming the space relative to the size of the text.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You can also specify margin, padding and border for each side of the box through:</p>
      <br>
      <p>The CSS code is written like this:</p>
      <ul> 
        <li>margin-top:</li> 
        <li>margin-right:</li>
        <li>margin-bottom:</li>
        <li>margin-left:</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Or as one piece of code to represent all four sides:</p>
      <br>
      <p>margin: 1em 2em 2em 3em;</p>
      <br>
      <p>You can also specify many different border styles such as:</p>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/example-4.png" alt="Example four" class="example-four-img"><figcaption>Border example styles</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <p>For example, to represent a ‘dashed border’ you would write:</p>
      <br>
      <p>border: dotted;</p>
      <br>
      <p>To specify size of the border with one value:</p>
      <br>
      <p>border-width: 1px;</p>
      <br>
      <p>When to use Margins, Padding and Borders:</p>
      <br>
      <p>In regular use margins are good for adjusting the spacing of an element in conjunction with another element, i.e. positioning elements in relation with each other.  
        Padding is good for when you're adjusting the look of a particular element like changing the space or amount of pixels contained within the box or div. 
        Borders are useful to separate elements from other elements or containers. 
        They are also handy when you're arranging elements on a page to clearly see where everything is located. 
      </p>
