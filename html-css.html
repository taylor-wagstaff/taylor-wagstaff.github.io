      <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
  
     
  
        
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>margin</p>
      <p>/ˈmɑːdʒɪn/</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>noun</p>
      <p>1.</p>
      <p>The edge or border of something.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>border</p>
      <p>/ˈbɔːdə/</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>noun</p>
      <p>1.</p>
      <p>The edge or boundary of something, or the part near it.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>padding</p>
      <p>/ˈpadɪŋ/</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>noun</p>
      <p>1.</p>
      <p>Soft material such as foam or cloth used to pad or stuff something.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Following each of these definitions above we can begin to understand what these terms mean individually within a CSS context. 
        If we follow the CSS box model, which simply means a box or container holding content, such as text, we can visualize how each 
        of these terms signify how they are meant to be understood. Each box can contain margins, borders and padding. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Here’s an example of a castle to help us visualize these properties:</p>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/castle.png" alt="Castle" class="castle"><figcaption>Castle as example</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Here’s an example of a box model to help us visualize these properties for CSS:</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/example-1.png" alt="Example one" class="example-one-img"><figcaption>Box Model as example</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Above, we can see how each of these terms relate to their inferred meaning. 
        The margin, by the definition above, functions as the edge occupying around the content of the box.
        Think of the margin as the grass that surrounds the castle. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Second is the border, which is nested between the margin and padding. 
        The border is the boundary or the castle’s outer walls so to speak.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Finally the padding, if we return to the above definition as a “soft material such as foam or cloth used to pad or stuff something” is a helpful way to visualize how the padding operates. 
        The padding, which is normally the same as the background color as defined for the box container, packs the content or wraps the content in an area of empty space.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>When applied in CSS, the margin, padding and border can all be increased or decreased in size through declaring how much or how little in number declarations. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/example-2.png" alt="Example two" class="example-two-img"><figcaption>Box Model number specifying</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>We can then see each specific properties for the margin, padding and border. 
        In the above example in the browser, the border is set as ‘solid thin black’, the margin has a size of ‘2em’ and the padding is ‘2em’ as well. 
        An ‘em’ is a unit of measurement, although ‘px’ for pixels can also be used. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The following CSS code below represents the example above.
         This section of code is stored in your CSS file and determines how the HTML should look:
      </p>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/example-3.png" alt="Example three" class="example-three-img"><figcaption>CSS code example</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <p>Specifying padding and margins in em is good practice as it allows easier transformation in different mobile formats. 
        Em works by conforming the space relative to the size of the text.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You can also specify margin, padding and border for each side of the box through:</p>
      <br>
      <p>The CSS code is written like this:</p>
      <ul> 
        <li>margin-top:</li> 
        <li>margin-right:</li>
        <li>margin-bottom:</li>
        <li>margin-left:</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Or as one piece of code to represent all four sides:</p>
      <br>
      <p>margin: 1em 2em 2em 3em;</p>
      <br>
      <p>You can also specify many different border styles such as:</p>
      <br>
      <figure><img src="blog/Images/example-4.png" alt="Example four" class="example-four-img"><figcaption>Border example styles</figcaption></figure>
      <br>
      <p>For example, to represent a ‘dashed border’ you would write:</p>
      <br>
      <p>border: dotted;</p>
      <br>
      <p>To specify size of the border with one value:</p>
      <br>
      <p>border-width: 1px;</p>
      <br>
      <p>When to use Margins, Padding and Borders:</p>
      <br>
      <p>In regular use margins are good for adjusting the spacing of an element in conjunction with another element, i.e. positioning elements in relation with each other.  
        Padding is good for when you're adjusting the look of a particular element like changing the space or amount of pixels contained within the box or div. 
        Borders are useful to separate elements from other elements or containers. 
        They are also handy when you're arranging elements on a page to clearly see where everything is located.
